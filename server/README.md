To run this express.js app(server), you need to have nodejs and npm installed on your system, for this I suggest you the official website of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Now just run the following command in the terminal and you will see server running.
```cd path/to/server
node index.js```
The server will run on port 80 of your system (you can change port in index.js).
