To run this reactjs app, you need to have nodejs and npm installed on your system, for this I suggest you the official website of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

In the next step, you need to create a reactjs project in this folder using npm in your system, for this I suggest you the [reactjs](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) website.

then you can run project in main project folder using :

```
cd path/to/worldreact
npm start
```

you can export a build version of this using : 

```
cd path/to/worldreact
npm run build
```

then you can use your new changes in UI by copying build folder to server folder.

enjoy playing with codes !
