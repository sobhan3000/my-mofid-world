**3D web-based software for managing tasks and daily planning**

**i call it Mofid App**

The entire program (server side and client side) is open source on this page, which you can use to learn and practice JavaScript, express.js, babylonjs and react.js.

There are two folders in Git, the folder named server contains the express.js server code along with a build version of the react part of our project.
In the second folder, which is called worldreact, the react and babylonjs codes are located along with the required software files such as 3D models and images.

For more information about the project, please read the readme.md files inside the two folders I described, which contain information on how to install and run the code and other things.

!! The process of commenting and sorting the codes is still in progress
